# Odin Recipes

This is my first project from The Odin Projectâ€™s Foundations course. The goal of this project is to build a basic recipe website using only HTML. The site includes multiple recipe pages linked from a main index page.

By completing this project, I will demonstrate my ability to:
- Structure content using semantic HTML
- Create and link multiple HTML files
- Use text formatting, lists, and images
- Follow best practices for organizing HTML files

This project helps build a strong foundation in web development before moving on to CSS and JavaScript.
